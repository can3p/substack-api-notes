# Notes on substack API

Substack is a great platform for writing, they've done a fantastic amount of things in the way others should have years ago. The only thing that's missing for me is a cli client which would allow work on posts locally, put them on version control and do all other nice stuff we all like to do.

There is no public API hence everything in this repo is a result of experiments and reverse engineering, use at your own risk!
